The analysis of the 2022 U.S. Household Income Dataset provides valuable insights into state-level income trends and geographical characteristics. The study identifies the states with the largest land and water areas, ranking the top 10 in each category to highlight geographical disparities. By examining state-level household income statistics, the analysis determines the states with the highest and lowest incomes based on average mean and median values. The results reveal significant variations, with municipalities and Census Designated Places (CDPs) showing the highest household incomes, while urban and community areas reflect lower averages. These findings suggest notable economic and demographic differences across regions. Additionally, the analysis uncovers that states with larger geographical areas do not always correspond to higher income levels, emphasizing the complexity of economic factors. This project showcases the ability to integrate geographic and economic datasets using SQL, delivering meaningful insights and demonstrating advanced data analysis skills.
